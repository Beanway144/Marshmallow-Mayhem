        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>
            The object of this game is for you and your group to create an 
            interesting story by each writing one or two lines of it - but 
            there's a twist: you don't know exactly what everyone else wrote! 
            Each person will take turns writing a few lines of the story. After 
            hitting the "submit" button, you then pass the computer to the next
            group member. The next group member will be able to see what you 
            wrote, but a few words will be missing to add some mystery. They 
            will then try to continue the story. At the end of the game, 
            everyone gets to read the final result!
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, select the number of people in your group on the 
            right. We recommend larger groups for the best possible experience!
            Then, select your prompt for some inspiration. Once you're ready,
            hit Start!
