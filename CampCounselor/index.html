        <h2><u>How To Play</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: left">
            Welcome to the first day of summer camp! The game starts with 3 to 10 players sitting in a circle. Choose
            one
            person to be the first counselor (or if nobody volunteers, choose the last person who has been camping).
            Give
            the
            counselor the device to setup the game (on the right). When everyone is ready, the counselor hits 'Start!'
            and
            passes the device to the player to their left.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
            Each camper will be prompted with a series of input boxes asking for words or phrases (nouns, adjectives,
            questions, etc.). Campers submit their answers by hitting the "Done!" button, then passing the device to
            their right. After all campers submit their responses, the device returns to the counselor.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
            The counselor stands in front of the campers and delivers the introduction given to them. While the
            counselor gives their introduction, the goal of the game is to not laugh. The first person to laugh (camper
            or counselor) is eliminated.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
            After each round, the player to the right of the counselor is the new counselor, and the game continues
            until all but one of the players have been eliminated.
        </p>
